Crimson FX is an effect generator for Quicktime movies and DV streams designed to make adding laser and light blade effects (and possibly other effects) as easy as possible. I decided to write Crimson FX after reading an online tutorial about how to create rotoscoped Light Saber effects. Unfortunately, it required quite a chunk of expensive and complicated software to do it. I figured not everybody who would want to make their own home-rolled laser and light saber effects would have access to those fine programs, so I sat down and hacked one out. Fortunately, I was able to re-use a lot of code I'd written over the course of a couple of years. It took me just a few days to get a working copy. Then I got busy with work and life, and forgot about it.

Unfortunately, Quicktime 7 broke the compression code, so this version will compile, but may not work 100% on Leopard.
